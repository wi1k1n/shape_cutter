## Shape Cutter

A small tool, that has a limited functionality, namely:
1. Given the shape find best fit into the square (brute-forced)
2. Cuts the shape into subshapes (shape can be concave, but not self-intersected!)

Originally the idea of this toolset is to help estimating and searching for best placement of the objects on 3D-printer's heating plate.

## TODO:
- Mouse interaction for the cutting line
- Optimizing a single cut for the subshapes to fit the square
- Optimizing multiple cuts
- GUI help
